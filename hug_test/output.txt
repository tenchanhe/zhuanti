{'sequence': 'Videos can be played to add funTeachers are sometimes a little excited, and should respect and tolerate students&#39; different positions and ideasThe teacher will listen to everyone&#39;s narration before expressing his own ideas. He will not influence everyone&#39;s opinions, and will use various perspectives to increase everyone&#39;s thinkingThe teacher teaches very well, I like the teacher very much, come on, teacher!It&#39;s fun to listen to everyone&#39;s personal reportsHope to deepen the course of human rights theory!!The teacher is very serious in class, and will invite students to speak and respect different opinions. Every week, 2-3 students will be arranged to report on political-related news that happened that week, bringing current events into class discussions. The teacher often speaks some inspirational words suddenly~The teacher speaks very humorously and has his own ideasnoneNoI think it is very good for the teacher to ask the students to debate together, but the teacher will be too excited about the opinions of the students who are opposite to the teacher. What is it? Respect everyone&#39;s right to express their opinions!Being aggressive in debates with students can be a bit embarrassingThe teacher spoke very well, but because I am not Taiwanese, I don&#39;t understand Taiwanese political figures very well.The content of the teacher&#39;s class is very good, but the personal position is a bit too biased, there are too many texts, and the burden is a bit heavyIt is hoped that students can be grouped freelyTA class can suggest to add a mutual evaluation within the group, otherwise, except for the division of labor and comments in the report, you will not speak or come to TA classnoneCan be more vivid and closer to lifenonenot yetI personally think the midterm and final exams are really difficult! But the teacher is really good, he is very serious and good teacher!The invited lecturer gave a great speechThe teacher has worked hard~~~ I want to suggest that the teacher extend the deadline for the submission of the middle or final report, and everyone can write better! Thank you teacherThe teacher is a good person! The class is also very serious and fulfilling, but I still feel frustrated because I don’t know the teacher’s grading standards.Love the teacher&#39;s debating unitToo much homework, too hard examsTeachers encourage students to express their opinions and respond critically, triggering students to think more deeply.There are too many reports in the discussion class, and the roll call system is not clearI like to hear the teacher&#39;s opinionnoneSuggested text readings (class handouts) can be shortened. First of all, due to the limited ability of the students, they may not be able to finish the reading; secondly, if the teacher hastily brought it in class, it means that the teacher cannot explain it in detail. Suggestions can be divided into designated reading and reference reading; while designated reading is compiled into handouts, one text reading per week, and reference reading is opened as a book list or chapter title.It encourages students to think independently and puts forward many viewpoints that I have never thought about before. This semester has benefited a lot!It is good for the teacher to ask us to debate this idea, but the teacher does not respect the students&#39; arguments. When the students have a different position from the teacher, they will directly raise objections, without listening to how the students agree with this argument.If the political science class of juniors and sisters is taught by Mr. Wei Hongwu, the seniors will give you a few points for your reference. 1. You will be asked to buy an original text book at the beginning of the semester, but the teacher will not bring you along. The book is bought for yourself to read. 2. The way of class is to first use PPT to give lectures according to the chapters of the textbook, and then to debate a controversy in political science. The time of the two parts is about one to one, but they are all about publishing personal?Paying too much attention to the explanation of English terms during the exam (many foreign students may never read the original political texts in their entire lives)I thought that this should be the case for university courses, encouraging students to speak more and giving students the opportunity to report on stage. This is a good attempt for freshmen!The teaching is great but the original text is slightly redundantThe teacher&#39;s roll call and answering questions are almost the same peopleI hope that I can give examples to extend the content of the textbookI like the warm feeling when everyone is discussing together, the head will turn quicklyI hope that the teacher can talk more about current affairs, and think and discuss in many ways.Omit too much class content, almost all students are asked to report, and the gains are not great. It is a waste of time to keep asking questions if you want to create a lively discussion. Sometimes he insists on his own opinion too much, interjecting without waiting for the students to finish speaking, a bit disrespecting the students&#39; opinions.Voluntary speaking can be included in the bonus standardYou can talk more about the content of the class and less about the classmate reportSometimes the teacher&#39;s questioning of the debate creates pressure on the studentsTeachers can give more examples that actually exist so that students can better understand theoretical thingsThe teacher sometimes puts too much emphasis on debate and less progress, but overall I think it&#39;s not badThe content of the lecture can be clarifiedThe teacher encourages the students to speak, but I feel that the content of the class is not solid enough. I hope that more explanations can be given in the key parts, so that the students can only explore by themselves.Teachers can stimulate students to think, but sometimes they skip some things in class, hoping to fill up the textbook content.Don&#39;t let reports take up a bunch of class timeI really like the way of interaction in class, and the teacher directly points out the shortcomings of the students, which is very useful to usThe frequency of roll call can be increased to respect students who attend every classWeekly reports can enhance students&#39; ability to in-depth inquiry and independent thinking on current affairs issuesIt is a waste of time for every student to report, consider grouping.The mid-term test scores are so low, I can only work hard at the end of the termI really like that the teacher constantly challenges everyone&#39;s views and promotes thinking. I hope to learn more from the teacher, but it is a pity that this course only has two credits, and the time control of the students who report in the second section is probably not very good, resulting in insufficient time and shallow courses. I hope that the students in the next semester can finish their reports within the period, so that they will have time to fully discuss.The teacher encourages students to put forward their views on the political market, which helps us to think logicallyThe teacher is really punctual, and the class starts as soon as the clock hits, but even if you sprint down the mountain with a 100-meter sprint, it is still too late for the last class, so sometimes the teacher has already started the class, or when reporting important matters, you can only learn from it. cut in. If you can, I hope that the teacher can wait for three to five minutes, and wait for the students who came to class from the border areas~I really feel very lucky to have taken the teacher&#39;s class. Each class has a different harvest and makes me think differently, making the blunt political science in books vividThe compression of the main courses of the two-credit course leads to overly focused teaching, which is a bit like cramming.Lesson content can be found in more depthPolitical parties are too subjectiveThe interactive discussion between the teacher and the students is very sufficient, but the teacher sometimes skips a lot of class content and lets the students read it by themselves. I think the course content is a bit insufficient.make the exam easierThe test method is still better than the originalDon&#39;t have so many reports! ! ! 1/2 of the report is really too much. The noun explanation of the exam was very hard to memorize, but I felt that it was not practical. But it is better than last semester, and the quiz will urge you to study.Provide us with a new perspective to see things, not just oneThe score is sweet, the exam is simple, and it is a good choice to raise the average; it can also develop independent thinking and keen insights, praise. Fortunately, I took it before graduation, otherwise I would have missed studying Zhengda, and it was better than any other courses. I sincerely recommend it.I think the part of the teacher&#39;s lecture can be more, and the part of the student&#39;s report can be shortenedThe teacher is really great! The content is very deep and broad and has always encouraged us to think independently,The part of random exams is actually quite stressful. Although there will be no collision with the midterm exam week, the preparation time will increase a lotLikes to ask questions and discuss reports some are funAlthough the students in the department seem to generally dislike it, it is quite suitable for those who like to think or challenge argumentsThe content of the teacher&#39;s class is very good, and the opinions on political issues are very in-depth, but it takes up too much time in the class for five presenters to report on stage every time. What I hope is to hear the teacher&#39;s comprehensive opinions.The quiz system should be abolished, otherwise the date of the quiz will be clearly set.In addition to noun explanations and application questions, I hope that the exam has other aspects.Although I have always been in contact with social science or even social issues, some of the views of the teacher in the classroom have brought me different inspirations, thank you teacherThe teacher&#39;s exposition is simple and organized, and students can absorb a lot of political science-related knowledge invisibly in class. However, it is recommended that if teachers discuss topics or knowledge related to other subjects (economics, law, etc.) in class, they can discuss with students the most correct answers. I believe students will gain more.It is suggested to focus more on the system and political ecology of the country, after all, the textbooks are written by the United States.Thank you teacher for choosing your class this semester. It is very good, but sometimes the PPT lectures in class are too fast to copy notes. I hope I can put the PPT on the Internet for students who need it to study again. Thank you teacher for your guidance this semester.Thank you teacher for respecting every student&#39;s opinion, and motivating students to think, criticize and reflect on different issues in the form of debate. After a semester, I have gained a lot.Give us a lot of opportunities to express our opinions, very good~ The teacher also provided a lot of opinions, praiseRespect students&#39; opinionsIf the professor thinks what should be taught, he can do it without being bound by textbooks. Students study this course, the original intention is the same as what the professor wants to teach. (There is no need to worry about the fact of the textbook, PPT is a kind of textbook.)I think the class is very interesting, the teacher is also very knowledgeable and can often put forward very different points of view for us to think about the debate in the class. I also find it very interestingGood class, the teacher worked hard, I really like the debate part in the classinteresting debateThe textbooks are very old and the information has not been updated. Most of the courses can be understood from the textbooks. I hope to go deeper. Not very helpful overall, much like reviewing high school civics.I really like the teacher&#39;s incisive insights, and I also like the sharp feedback, a class that helps thinkingI really like that the teacher allows us to debate and express opinions on various issues in the classroom, but I think that if we can conduct group discussions before the debate on the issues, it may make everyone&#39;s views more qualitative. In addition, I hope that the teacher can act more professionally when replying to the students&#39; opinions. Even if the students put forward some funny arguments today, the teacher can chooseThe teacher is very serious, but can be more tactful when expressing personal opinions, sometimes it can sound a little harsh, because not everyone thinks that way.noneThe teacher is very Q, you can speak up if you have any ideasI hope the teacher will not keep ordering people who are not in class to speak. Some people are shy and dare not speak until they click on it.Teacher Wei very much encourages students to speak and express their opinions; but sometimes he is a little aggressive when faced with students&#39; ideas. However, this does not detract from the teacher&#39;s professional knowledge in the field of political science and his rich views on things.Teachers will provide many different positions and viewpoints, encourage students to express their opinions, and answer students&#39; questions. In class, I will ask people to answer, and those who are not in class will be remembered. After that, the teacher will always pay attention to XD. The teacher will provide his own opinions. I personally think it is very useful, but when I ask students for their opinions, they will interrupt and refute the parts that the students did not say. Personally, I think Students are a bit disrespected, I hope the teacherThe scope of the exam is unclear and difficult to prepare forThe teacher is very good, I loveThe teacher would say &quot;Taiwanese media sucks&quot; and &quot;If you are unlucky to become reporters in the future...&quot;, I think such generalized remarks do not respect those serious journalists in Taiwan.nonenoneThe teacher is serious in class, and it is a class that promotes thinking!In fact, the end-of-term debate questions are more inclined to personal opinions, and I hope that higher marks can be given to avoid points being deducted due to position issues. In addition, other exam questions hope to be easierThe teacher is willing to encourage students to think independently, ask questions and discuss, which is not bad.nonenoneThe teacher is very serious in class, and the debate is also very exciting, but it would be nice if the teacher could be more &quot;gentle&quot; when hearing opinions that differ from his own during the debateThe teacher is very funny in class, and also discusses the opinions of the students, you can learn a lotI think it is much better than the political science file in my original department! (Purely personal preference, no intention to attack that teacher) The content of the lecture and the subsequent debate are very good, especially looking forward to the debate class!Speaking in class is encouragedVery good teaching encourages us to think and the class is funThe teacher is very cute? Because political science itself is quite a hard subject, it is difficult to prepare for the midterm and final. Compared with Internet gossip, I think the teacher himself is quite amiable. It takes a lot of time to read the text, otherwise there will be too little commentary.For those who are new to this subject, too many professional vocabulary will make people overwhelmed, hope to adjust the difficulty of the courseI really like that the teacher encourages students to speak and arranges many topic discussions outside the class to promote discussion and debate in the class and increase personal thinking ability. High-quality recommendationThe teacher has his own set of discussions and views on various events, which can help me think about many issues that I have never thought about. Although I agree with the teacher most of the time, I suggest that students who disagree with the teacher not rush to refute, and also to try againstI really like the teacher&#39;s teaching method that jumps out of the framework, but I don&#39;t know if it is because the course is full of courses and I feel that some courses are not particularly in-depth. Generally speaking, I think the teacher&#39;s class is very good, especially the topic discussion part!I really recommend Professor Wei. In addition to the main class, there is also a debate time in the class. It really makes the students feel like they are seriously participating in it. I really recommend everyone to take this class.The content of the textbook is a bit too heavy, and the scope of the test term explanation is too wideThe teacher is attentive in classAlthough it is general social studies, I suggest that students should buy genuine textbooks, which is more in line with the principle of fair use.I feel that I have learned a lot and understand how to look at and analyze a thing from a rational point of view, but the first big question in the exam is difficult.The topic debates and classmate reports every week can help me understand and think about various topics, praise!Teachers will encourage students to think independently about political issues and put forward their own opinions and positions. I learned a lot from it~Encourage students to speak to promote thinkingThe teacher welcomes students to express their opinions very much in class, encourages students to put forward their own opinions, and gives students opportunities to reflect, which benefits me a lotI hope that the teacher can guide the application of political science in case analysis, which will be very helpful for beginners in political scienceIt is not appropriate to evaluate students&#39; speeches emotionallyThe report system in the Americas allowed me to grasp many issues and current events. The teacher has his own ideas on various issues and is usually persuasive. I just hope that the teacher will not keep interrupting when the classmates are speaking in the future, it will be a bit oppressive~Although during the debate, I was refuted to the point of being unable to speak because my arguments and ideas were not solid enough, but it also made me want to work harder to train this ability, so I think it is quite rewarding to be able to debate with the teacher!Very interesting class, encourage students to think and answer positively, but it is easy to fail to follow without preview.I hope I can talk a little more about the things in the textbook, otherwise I feel that it is useless to preview for so longnoneslightly heavier textThe teacher is great, and taking this class this semester opened up my interest in political science.Teachers are active on the podium, have clear arguments, and are loved by students.too personalYou can freely express your own opinions. The teacher immediately thinks positive and negative. I think it is very powerful. Although I was not interested in political science before the midterm exam because the teacher&#39;s position is quite biased, it will be less obvious in the next semester. I gradually fell in love with political science!One of the best classes I&#39;ve ever taken, learned a lot, thanks!I really like the debate in the second quarter. I hope that one or two activities will be grouped first. After checking the information, we will debate every other week. It will be very interesting1. The debate topic in the second class is a bit too difficult for non-political students, and it is difficult to arouse students&#39; interest. The teacher may consider using current affairs news related to the debate topic to give more examples to arouse students&#39; interest in discussion and discussion , otherwise everyone would be quiet in the second class and not too involved in the discussion. Instead, the students in the third class reported recent social news, and the students were relatively focused and interested in understanding. 2. There is a serious generation gap between the teacher and the students. Although the teacher welcomes any opinions, sometimes the tone of voice will make the students feel that you have already established a predetermined position, and they are too lazy to tell you. The teacher has a mantra. Your personal opinion will say &quot;right&quot;, making it difficult for students who think you are &quot;wrong&quot; to communicate with you.finenoneLoved this class! In particular, the debate part really taught people the importance of looking at things from different angles and multi-faceted thinking!The teacher will point students to express their opinions, but sometimes the teacher may not notice other students raising their hands. I hope the teacher can pay more attention so that other students who have not been pointed by the teacher can also express their opinions.It is a very friendly class for those who are new to political science. If you can&#39;t fully express the semantic meaning during the debate, the professor will help you to organize it. Debate class will be more rewarding if you have some constructive ideas.The debate session is quite effective for learning, but because it is a half-year course, the content is not deep enoughIt is suggested that the teacher can adjust the proportion of mid-term and end-of-term, maybe 25% each, because it is a bit too heavy to directly account for 50% at the end of the term. If the performance in the mid-term happens to be good, but the end of the term may be a little abnormal, it will affect the overall score. But I still like this class quite a lot. Many points of view in the debate part can stimulate self-thinking! Thank you, teacher!Thanks to the professor for his dedication. In addition to helping us establish the most basic concepts of political science, the exchange of ideas during the discussion class also allows us to think about the same thing from different angles and break the original limited thinking path. Thank you, professor , the professor has worked hard!I learnt a lot from this course. It increased my political perspective and spectrum from what I knew before. It also encouraged students to develop independent thinking.Learned a lot through debate, and inspire me to think on the spot and my skill in formulating a logical argumentThank you, teacher! Taking political science this semester has been very rewarding for me. I really like that the teacher encourages us to speak in class, which makes me think in class from time to time and generate many different ideas! The class went through various adventures at the beginning (?) to be able to continue. At the beginning, I also thought about quitting the election altogether, but I am very glad that I stayed in the end. The small first class allowed me to get to know my classmates better, and there was less pressure in class and speaking. I really like this class!Thank you professor for your patient teaching and providing opportunities for debate to stimulate our thinking and debate.Loved the teacher&#39;s debate session very much, I think it is an effective way to promote more independent thinking!Understand that the teacher is simply debating and thinking about himself as the opponent of the students’ position in class, but students may subconsciously be discouraged by the teacher’s sense of authority, so the discussion may not seem so flexibleThe teaching content is comprehensive and in-depth. The teacher carefully explains the external arguments and is neutral, and guides students to think in multiple ways. However, it is suggested that teachers should wait for the students to finish their speeches before commenting when students express their positions, so as to help students fully explain their positions and avoid fragmented arguments.The teacher&#39;s class is really interesting, I look forward to his class every week', 'labels': ['high score', 'busy', 'difficult', 'hard', 'low score', 'sweet', 'cold', 'easy'], 'scores': [0.8756489753723145, 0.8729855418205261, 0.8410786390304565, 0.8227406144142151, 0.7671584486961365, 0.7385244369506836, 0.6450152397155762, 0.546899676322937]}
